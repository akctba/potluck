# Potluck Project
Project to test ZeroServer.js framework.
<br>
Webapp that proposes to manage what each guest will bring to a potluck event.

## Features
* Simple to use.
* Invite by email.
* Guests list.
* Dishes list.
* Suggested dishes/beverages/items by the organizer.
* Guests can add their own dishes.
* Organizer can choose if the page will show 'who' will bring 'what'.

## Problematic
Potluck events are fun and great time to met friends and family, try new recepies, revisit best dishes and enjoy the warm that food (and üç∑, üçª, ü•Ç üòÑ) brings to our souls. However, the discussion about who-bring-what takes time, more and more scarce, and each personal decision can take time to think about.

## Objectives
Create an online tool where all guests can check how the event is being supplied and where they can communicate what they are planning to bring.<br>
In the future, features to engage the participation can be added.
